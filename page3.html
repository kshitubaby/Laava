  <h2>My Love ❤️</h2>

  <p>
    Happy 1 Year Laavanya Joshi, My love.  
    <br><br>
    One year ago this very day I saw you. I cant forget that day. One of the most amazing and special day it was in my life.
    We had our nmat exam, but i didnt care. I was more focused on meeting you. I know I bought a new jacket and didnt wear it at all 
    and then I wore those new clothes to look good in front of you. I was scared ke kahi tum mujhe dekh ke pasand na karo.
    <br><br>
    I wanted to meet you the day we started talking to charm you to make you mine hug you kiss you and make you feel the most special girl.
    We from the day we started talking till this day an ever ago I waited for you just to give you a hug and love you in person. 
    That day when you went home I was so angryy because I didnt care about the exam, I came just to see you and meet you. 
    I came with the plan ke aaj toh isse permanent karke jaunga but you left and mujhe khud pe gussa aa raha tha but 
    then you came we went to colocal, just had a one coffee and had ending talking and
    <br><br>
    How can I forget that walk towards you outside colocal, giving you a cute kiss I dont know why I did that all I know that it came natural. 
    Mai apko apna mann chuka tha in that waiting period and it just came and thank you for not slapping me for doing that.
    <br><br>
    I was so scared after doing it because I realized what I did after I did and I was like fuck kardiya kshitijjj 
    From that day to today exactly 1 year after, I am still like this ke fuck kardiya kshitij and you are still like I love you kshitij.
    This 1 year made us through lots of ups and downs and kept us together. We stuck with each other. 
    Us from fighting like dogs and cats to meeting our parents and loved by them. I can never thought of doing this with anyone but you 
    You made me who I'm and I'm the happiest with who im. i can proudly say that im my woman's man and she has all the rights to me.
    <br><br>
    thank you so much for loving me, thank you so much for entertaining my stupidness, thank you so much for keeping me close to you.
    It us against the world jaan and like this one year I would want to spend the rest of the years with you.
    <br><br>
    Happy 1 yr anniversary my bobo, my shona, my baby, my angry bird. 
     I love you the mosttt.
    <br><br> 
    Always yours ❤️
  </p>
